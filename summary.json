      "section_title": "1. Desktop Review",
      "content_type": "Text",
      "body_text": "Purpose: The desktop review serves as a foundational step for understanding the broader gender context before engaging communities directly.\n\nKey Points:\n- The goal of the desktop review is to understand the prevailing status of gender equality within the agricultural sector in the country, region, or project area.\n- Key documents include national gender policies, regional agricultural policies, gender assessments, and previous project reports.\n- The desktop review helps answer questions such as: How unequal are men and women in terms of access to land, income, extension services, markets, and technology?\n- Another purpose is to evaluate how well gender is integrated into the project strategy. This includes checking whether the project proposal mentions women, men, and youth as separate groups with unique needs.\n- Review project activity plans to determine whether gender has been considered in activity design—for example, timing of training, location, who is invited, and the type of activities planned.\n- Mapping existing supporters and influencers in market systems helps identify the institutional ecosystem, including extension agents, input dealers, cooperatives, financial services, and government bodies."

      "section_title": "2. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs): Introduction and Consent",
      "content_type": "Text",
      "body_text": "Purpose: FGDs help gather group-based insights on gendered experiences, roles, and needs in agriculture.\n\nKey Points:\n- FGDs should include diverse demographic groups such as men, women, young women, young men, and persons living with disabilities (PLWDs).\n- Each FGD should take around 1–2 hours and must begin with warm introductions, purpose explanation, and consent.\n- Participants must be informed that there are no right or wrong answers. Every opinion matters, and differences in views are welcome and expected.\n- Participants are reminded that they do not need to answer every question, and they should respect each other’s opportunity to speak.\n- Explain that notes will be taken and discussions may be recorded to ensure accuracy. Permissions for photos must be requested.\n- Confidentiality must be emphasized — names will never appear in reports.\n- Once consent is obtained, the FGD begins with introductions: name, whether the participant is affiliated with the project, and how."

      "section_title": "3. Gender Roles and Division of Labor in Agriculture",
      "content_type": "Text",
      "body_text": "Purpose: To understand how labor responsibilities are divided between men and women and how this impacts time, workload, and opportunities.\n\nKey Points:\n- Gender roles define who performs which tasks in agricultural production. Women often perform unpaid tasks such as weeding, sorting, processing, and household duties.\n- Men may dominate paid labor tasks like plowing, land clearing, and transportation of produce.\n- The activity list includes tasks like clearing land, plowing, composting, planting, weeding, fertilizing, irrigating, harvesting, processing, sorting, storage, and marketing.\n- Input supply analysis looks at who goes to get seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, or tools. Women may face restrictions like less mobility or access to cash.\n- Marketing roles such as who negotiates prices or takes produce to the market often fall to men, while women may do sorting or cleaning at home.\n- Collective participation (farmer groups, cooperatives) often favors men due to leadership norms, meeting schedules, mobility, and ownership requirements."

      "section_title": "4. Market System Actors and Relationships",
      "content_type": "Text",
      "body_text": "Purpose: To examine how farmers interact with different actors in the market system and how gender norms influence these relationships.\n\nKey Points:\n- Participants draw a circle representing a farmer and list all market actors they interact with: input suppliers, banks, traders, aggregators, processors, extension workers, and information service providers.\n- Participants indicate whether they interact with men or women in these roles and whether the interactions occur inside or outside the community.\n- Distance matters: women may travel less due to safety concerns or household responsibilities.\n- Participants rate the quality of relationships on a scale of 1–6 and explain reasons behind trust or mistrust.\n- They also identify which relationships they want to strengthen and specify long-term farming goals and how actor relationships can help them progress."

      "section_title": "5. Gendered Time Use Diary",
      "content_type": "Text",
      "body_text": "Purpose: To compare how men and women use their time over a 24-hour cycle and across seasons.\n\nKey Points:\n- Daily Activity Clocks illustrate how women and men spend each hour of the day.\n- Women often multitask (childcare, cooking, cleaning, and farming) and have longer workdays.\n- Men may focus more on specific tasks such as herding, plowing, or marketing.\n- The tool reveals differences in leisure time, sleep, and workload intensity.\n- Seasonal differences help identify when farmers are more or less available for project activities (training, meetings)."

      "section_title": "6. Gendered Access to Essential Services",
      "content_type": "Text",
      "body_text": "Purpose: To analyze differences between how men, women, and youth access agricultural services.\n\nKey Points:\n- Access to certified seeds may be influenced by finances, decision-making authority, mobility, and networks.\n- Credit access is often more difficult for women and youth due to collateral requirements, land ownership restrictions, and financial literacy gaps.\n- Access to farming information (good practices) depends on literacy, training timing, group membership, and extension worker outreach.\n- Extension services often reach men more because men attend meetings or control the farm.\n- Access to fertilizer and inputs may depend on who controls income and who is allowed to interact with suppliers.\n- Time-saving technologies (mechanized tools, processing machines) may be harder for women to access due to cost or cultural norms.\n- Marketing and agribusiness services often favor men who travel freely and have decision-making power."

      "section_title": "7. Key Informant Interviews",
      "content_type": "Text",
      "body_text": "Purpose: To collect insights from market actors and service providers on gender-related opportunities and constraints.\n\nKey Points:\n- Producers are interviewed to understand gendered perceptions of farming roles, access to resources, decision-making power, and involvement in spaces of influence.\n- Input providers discuss challenges farmers face accessing inputs and whether gender influences who becomes an input dealer.\n- Cooperatives share information on membership rules, leadership structures, inclusion strategies, and barriers related to gender and youth.\n- Extension workers highlight support systems, training gaps, feedback mechanisms, and gender constraints in service delivery.\n- Financial service providers explain barriers to loans, effectiveness of women-friendly programs, and non-financial support such as business training.\n- Millers and processors discuss market entry requirements, gender barriers, and strategies for success.\n- Wholesalers and retailers identify constraints in agribusiness growth and how traditional practices influence gender roles and opportunities."

      "section_title": "8. Observation Guide",
      "content_type": "Text",
      "body_text": "Purpose: To observe real-life behaviors, participation patterns, and gender dynamics.\n\nKey Points:\n- Observe presence of men, women, youth, and PLWDs in community spaces and note who is absent.\n- Assess accessibility of community resources such as markets, schools, and water points and who uses them.\n- Analyze participation in village gatherings: who speaks, who attends, who leads, and whether timing favors certain groups.\n- During development activities, note who pays attention, who multitasks, and whether women or men dominate discussions.\n- Observe body language: confidence, discomfort, agreement, disagreement.\n- During FGDs, evaluate who participates actively and who appears intimidated, shy, or disengaged."
